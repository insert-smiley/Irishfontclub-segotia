# Irishfontclub-segotia
January 2025 Gaelic typeface with new and old Irish characters
First font release by Irish Font Club. Inspired by the Intertype Bold Irish Type font from 1913, this is a regular upright Irish script with a slightly condensed width. It features all 36 letters from the original (upper & lowercase), old Irish characters (long s, long r, tironian et, dot séimiú) + modern alternatives. I've made some changes, its not as heavy and the in and out-strokes are more abstract. This single weight font works best in Irish but it can handle a mix of English and Irish languages and can be used as display and body text. It can be "more" or "less" old Irish depending on the long s alternate. There are 150 characters with this release. Please let me know if you want something particular to be added. Even for other language uses.

Segotia isn't a gaelic word, its old Dublin slang and is mostly used in the context of "me aul segotia" which may be roughly translated as "me old mucker" and if you don't know what that means, I can't help you any further...
